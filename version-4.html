    <p class="intro"><em>John Baskerville</em> (1706–1775) was an English businessman whose entrepreneurial attentions included japanning and papier-mâché; he is, however, best remembered as a typographer and printer, not least for the design of the eponymous typeface which, to this very day, bears his name.</p>

<p><em>Baskerville</em> was born in the village of <em>Wolverley</em>, near <em>Kidderminster</em> in <em>Worcestershire</em>, and worked as a printer in <em>Birmingham</em>. <em>Baskerville</em> printed works for the <em>University of Cambridge</em> and, although an atheist, printed a splendid folio bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly admired by <em>Benjamin Franklin</em>, a printer and fellow member of the <em>Royal Society of Arts</em>, who took the designs back to the newly-created <em>United States</em>, where they were adopted for most federal government publishing.</p>

<p><em>Baskerville</em> was responsible for numerous innovations in printing, paper and ink production. He developed a technique which produced a smoother whiter paper which showcased his strong black type. He also pioneered a completely new style of typography, adding wide margins and generous leading to improve legibility.</p>

<blockquote><strong>“Having been an early admirer of the beauty of letters, I became insensibly desirous of contributing to the perfection of them. I formed to myself ideas of greater accuracy than had yet appeared, and had endeavoured to produce a set of types according to what I conceived to be their true proportion.”</strong>

<small>John Baskerville, preface to Milton, 1758 <em>(Anatomy of a Typeface)</em></small>

<br>
<p><em><strong>Baskerville</strong></em> is a Transitional serif typeface designed by <em>John Baskerville</em> in 1757, positioned between the Old Style typefaces of <em>William Caslon</em>, and the modern styles of <em>Giambattista Bodoni</em> and <em>Firmin Didot</em>.</p>
<br>
<p>The typeface is the result of <em>Baskerville’s</em> intent to improve upon the types of <em>William Caslon</em>. He increased the contrast between thick and thin strokes, making the serifs sharper and more tapered, and shifted the axis of rounded letters to a more vertical position. The curved strokes are more circular in shape, and the characters became more regular. These changes created a greater consistency in size and form.</p>
<br>
<p><em>Baskerville’s</em> work was criticized by jealous competitors and soon fell out of favour. Since the 1920s, however, numerous revivals of <em>Baskerville</em> have been released by Linotype, Monotype, and other type foundries. <em>Émigré</em> released a popular revival of the typeface in 1996 called <em><strong>Mrs Eaves</strong></em>, named for <em>Baskerville’s</em> wife, <em>Sarah Eaves</em>. <em><strong>Baskerville</strong></em> represents the peak of Transitional type face design and bridges the gap between Old Style and Modern type design.</p

<p><em><strong>Mrs Eaves</strong></em> is named after <em>Sarah Eaves</em>, the woman who became <em>John Baskerville’s</em> wife. As <em>Baskerville</em> was setting up his printing and type business, <em>Mrs. Eaves</em> moved in with him as a live-in housekeeper, eventually becoming his wife after the death of her first husband, <em>Mr. Eaves</em>. <em><strong>Mrs Eaves</strong></em> is a revival of the types of English printer and punchcutter <em>John Baskerville</em>, and is related to contemporary <em><strong>Baskerville</strong></em> typefaces.</p>
<br>
<p>Like <em><strong>Baskerville</strong></em>, <em><strong>Mrs Eaves</strong></em>, cut by <em>Zuzana Licko of Émigré</em>, has a near vertical stress, departing from the Old Style model. Identifying characters, similar to <em><strong>Baskerville’s</strong></em> types, are the lowercase g with its open lower counter and swashlike ear. Both the roman and italic uppercase <strong>Q</strong> have a flowing swashlike tail. The uppercase <strong>C</strong> has serifs at top and bottom; there is no serif at the apex of the central junction in uppercase <strong>W</strong>; and the uppercase <strong>G</strong> has a sharp spur suggesting a vestigial serif.</p>
